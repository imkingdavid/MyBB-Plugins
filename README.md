###nofollowexternal.php
####No Follow External
Quite simply, it will add rel="nofollow" to external links, but not internal links. This should help improve SEO.

###regonlybbcode.php
####Registered Only BBCode
This adds a customizable bbcode tag that will prevent an unregistered user or banned user from viewing selective text without the need for making the entire forum section private.

###fixing_shit.php
####Fixing Shit
This is a plugin I've been working on for a bit to correct a problem that occured during an update to a MyBB forum I code on. Currently it will recount all the attachments for a thread, you can find the option to use it under Tools & Maintenance > Rebuild & Recount. This will also have any generic scripts for fixing problems dumped in here for easy access.
